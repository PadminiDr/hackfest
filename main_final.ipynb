      "1. Review Financial Statements: Start by reviewing the company's financial statements, specifically the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These statements provide information about the company's operations, investments, and financing activities.\n",

      "2. Identify Fixed Asset Purchases: Look for any entries in the cash flow statement or investing activities section related to the acquisition or purchase of fixed assets. Capital expenditures are typically associated with investments in property, plant, and equipment (PPE), such as buildings, machinery, or vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Determine Relevant Period: Identify the specific year and quarter for which you want to calculate the capital expenditure. This could be based on the financial statements or any specific reporting period mentioned in the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Calculate Capital Expenditure: Once you have identified the fixed asset purchases for the relevant period, you can sum up the values to calculate the capital expenditure. This value represents the total amount spent on acquiring or improving fixed assets during the specified period.\n",

      "Step 2: Locate the specific information: In the report, under the \"Investing Activities\" section, it states that capital investments totaled $582 million in the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "Step 3: Convert the value to billions: The capital expenditure value can be expressed in billions of US dollars by dividing the value by 1000.\n",
      "Step 4: Calculate the capex in billions: $582 million divided by 1000 equals $0.582 billion.\n",
